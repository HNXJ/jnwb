# Open stack (jnwb, 2026-10-25)

Empty. A row leaves by being repaired, shown false, or moved into the todo stack (`AGENTS.md` §11); `git log -- artifacts/open_stack.md` holds the rows of earlier dates.

Cleared 2026-10-25, the 40 rows of the audit of ac8736ff (`git show e00e8664:artifacts/open_stack.md`):

- Moved to the todo stack as 17-09 to 17-56, section "Audit of 2026-10-25", one defect per item (O-1 to O-5, O-7 to O-16, O-19 to O-26, O-32 to O-36, O-38 to O-41).
- Folded into existing items, whose text now carries them: O-27 (12-05, 09-07, 12-06, 07-05, 11-07, 12-11, 16-18, 15-22 rewritten), O-28 (the Accept clauses of 11-07, 11-09, 11-03, 12-07), O-29 (15-20 and 12-05), O-37 (17-01).
- Repaired with its item: O-30 (16-10, the I3 scan, landed 2026-10-25).
- Repaired: O-6 (both handoff notes moved outside the repository, hashes checked, ruled 2026-10-25); O-31 (S9's row names its holder's scope, ruled 2026-10-25; non-finite inputs are roadmap row 17-24).
- Moved to the roadmap: O-17 (roadmap 17-07).
- Shown false: the `waveform_index_dtype` refusal (the repair casts to uint8, so refusing values above 255 is correct); FM-16 (path misses inside dated rulings are records).

Opened and closed 2026-10-23: P-CI-1, CI red on `dev` at 18457f3a. Every test leg failed on `fig37_verify_written_nwb` (panel B counted pynwb's embedded schema datasets, whose number changes by release). Repaired in 2543f72f; the run on 93ab6a82 is green on every leg.
